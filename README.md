# DunkWare
simple little external python csgo cheat

features:
* box esp
* nametags
* healthbars
* glow
* very sus thirdperson
* bhop
* noflash
* aimlines
* overlay made with pyglet

issues:
* overlay doesnt work sometimes with fullscreen borderless windowed, so use these launch options

        -windowed -height 900 -width 1600 -noborder -novid

* performance is a bit iffy, overlay needs optimizing
* no menu
* offsets get broken randomly after a few matches, have to restart csgo
